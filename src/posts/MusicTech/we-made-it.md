# Using The Spotify API to Create Custom Apps

## February 5, 2020

Using APIs to create apps and software is still big in 2020. I spent part of last year using the Spotify Web API to create a web app called Tunechain. One of the biggest lessons I learned was how to properly navigate the documentation of an API so I can adapt what I need into the application that I'm building. The Spotify API is in my opinion one of the bigger site to peruse through and can be quite confusing. Here I will break down what I've learned if you want to use it.

### Before You Begin...

If you're wanting to build something using Spotify you first have to have a developer account to do so. Go to the [Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login). Once you create an account you will have a dashboard that will show all current apps you have authored.

### Now Onto The Docs Page

Once you arrive at the docs page you will see two main avenues to travel: docs by API/SDK or docs by feature. There are five main API/SDK to work with but we will explore the Web API for the purpose of this post. However to give you ideas you can also scroll down to the 'Explore by Feature' section with these options:

- Music Playback
- User Data
- Personalization
- Music Metadata
- Spotify Connect (for hardware integrations)

Spotify uses the API icons to show which types would work with each feature. The Web API and the Widgets are probably the most used of the kits and are compatible with most of the features listed. In the next blog post we will dive deeper into the Web API specifically to build a simple search app.

Part two is coming soon:
