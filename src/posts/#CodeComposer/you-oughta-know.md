Tuesday was another day of triumphs and struggles with an emphasis on struggles

I was having trouble with a Docker configuration and it basically took all day to fix it. However I did fix it. I also learned more about Blockchain in two separate Zoom meeting. Blockchain is definitely a direction my development career is going.

Hopefully I will get to solve more problems tomorrow
