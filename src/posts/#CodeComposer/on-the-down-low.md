I have cabin fever

I'm an introvert who works remotely so social distancing is already somewhat of a thing with me but I still like being around people. Being 'confined' at home can make me restless and eventually unproductive so I have to find ways to move around when coding.

I still have online interviews this week so I'm still trying to get work despite the uncertainty of this economy. April and May look to be tough months for our country so I'm glad I've gotten ahead of this

Also I apologize for the mini break I took from blogging but I needed the headspace. I will try my best to keep up the post from now on. Be safe and have a great week

### What I'm Working On
