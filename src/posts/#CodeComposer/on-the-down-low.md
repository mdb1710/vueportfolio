Yeah I'm not a fan of rain at all.

Rain can be peaceful but the gloomy weather can often take me out of my 'concentrated hustle' mode. The sun is supposed to break out today and like the sun I am going to break out with some new things for March.

Beside working on building my blogs I will also work more on my freelance project. I also started some convo for more work to help finish out the month. Hustling as a developer is hard but I am starting to find my footing.

I will also be carving out time to work on building a blockchain app with Sia and Skynet. It's gonna be a very busy first week in March.

### What I'm Working On

- Coding Challenge from potential employer
- Freelance work
- ReactATL Meetup
- Starting something on the Spoon App.

### What I Learning Right Now

- Blockchain 101
- Angular 9
