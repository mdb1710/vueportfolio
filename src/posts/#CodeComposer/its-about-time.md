# It's About Time

#### February 5, 2020

This section of Code Composer will be reserved for my daily musings as a developer. Because I am so much into music (especially 90's music) the title of each blog will be the title of a song from my favorite decade. Some will be hits and some with album cuts but I warn you that many will involve 'my girls' and formatted as below:

## Song: It's About Time

## Artist: SWV

## Album: It's About Time

## Release Year: 1992

So for today, it is about time. I spend a big part of my digital marketing career blogging for other people or creating strategies to promote other blogs. Blogging as a developer was often suggested but because of past career burnout. However the necessity of it for both career purposes and stress relief has led me back to (non-musical) writing. These will be quicker posts than normal blog posts will will be updated during the workweek.

### What I'm Working On

- So what I'm working on is finalizing my next freelance contract. I can't go into full details of the project but it will involve React & GraphQL.
- Obviously official launching the Code Composer blog
- Finishing the design for my Big Brother Canada quiz app
- Working on developing the relaunch of two of my other blogs - 90s Teen Culture & So Wrong For That

### What I Learning Right Now

- I'll be diving deeping into learning Apollo/GraphQL
- I will be finishing up learning more Angular/Firebase to get ready for Angular 9
