New month, new Monday, new money goals....

Being a freelance developer has its ups and its downs. Just like in sales you have to make sure your pipeline is on point. Even though I will be doing lots of coding today the bulk of my time this Monday will be searching and lining up jobs for the second quarter.

I will also focus on making sure I do more open source contributions starting with the React Native docs assigned to me. I almost feel like a real developer with this even though I'm just doing cleanup.

Happy March Monday y'all
