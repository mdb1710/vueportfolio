# Are You Gonna Go My Way

## February 10, 2020

It's a new week of coding and Monday is gonna Monday....

### Song: Are You Gonna Go My Way

### Artist: Lenny Kravitz

### Album: Are You Gonna Go My Way

### Release Year: 1993

This is the phrase I was yelling at my code early this morning. Diving into a new existing codebase for a new project can be very intimidating. Learning how to interpret it and use it is the job though. I also had another video interview in the middle of the morning so that interrupted my workflow.

However I am glad it's a new week and I am busy using code to build things. I'm learning more to ask for help quicker instead of relying on my wits and skills. Both the interview went well and the issue was solved by the end of the day. What more can you ask for on a rainy Monday?
