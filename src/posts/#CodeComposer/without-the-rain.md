I understand that rain is part of the 'circle of life' but it ruins so many plans. I mean both the literal rain and the figurative rain. Keeping up with tasks in the dev world is very different that in marketing and I'm still learning that. However my biggest stumbling block was solved this morning so I'm feeling sunny despite the rain.

I finally get the hype of Docker. I do need to learn more before I really use it but I do get it.
