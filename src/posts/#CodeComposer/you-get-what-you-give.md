# You Get What You Give

## February 12, 2020

It's a new week of coding and Monday is gonna Monday....

### Song: You Get What You Give

### Artist: The New Radicals

### Album: Maybe You've Been Brainwashed Too

### Release Year: 1998

I made the decision to let one of my 2019 projects go. I was working with someone and it seemed I was putting more in than I was receiving and burning me out in the process. I already have a knack for taking on more than needed so I always have to reaccess my time and my efforts. It was a hard decision and I know I will be better for it.

I also have had a Zoom meeting every day since Friday whether it was a dev interview or online dev meeting. Definitely eats up some of my work time but again I feel I'm getting a return from the time I am giving those meetings. Hope my Wednesday continues to be a productive push and pull.
