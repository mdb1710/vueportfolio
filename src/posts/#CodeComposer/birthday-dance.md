Happy Birthday To Me!

This birthday seems a lot more low key than other birthdays. Not just because it's not a 'flagship' year like other years. It's because I feel like I'm in the middle of a period than starting or ending one. However with all of the ups and downs that 2019 brought to me I am glad I made it on the other side of through.

I will be working on my major open source project via a Twitter exchange. I will be helping clean up the docs for the official Facebook React Native repo. If that is not a great tech birthday present I don't know what is.

Besides Ms. Badu and Mr. Bolton I don't think anyone shares my birthday but I do hope your 'regular' Wednesday is just as good
