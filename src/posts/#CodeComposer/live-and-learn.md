Happy Birthday to my brother Chris!

Happy Monday and Happy President's Day to everyone else. I titled this quick post Live & Learn partly because my brother made it to another year and partly because it's almost time for me to celebrate making another year.
After a year and some change in the tech world I learned a lot about career choices and how to navigate this world as a developer and devpreneur.  It's crazy the field I abandoned in college has now opened up so many possibilities later in life.

So I'm finishing up the coding challenge today.  There was no "official" time limit when I started but I want to have a timely response.  My week will consist of more coding and shipping and even converting an old laptop to a Linux machine.

Let's all live and learn this week.

### What I'm Working On

- Coding Challenge from potential employer
- Freelance work
- Finishing the design for my Big Brother Canada quiz app
- Starting something on the Spoon App.

### What I Learning Right Now

- Blockchain 101
- Angular 9
