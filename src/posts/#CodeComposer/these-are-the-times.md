This is the 'second wave' week everyone has been worried about. I hope all of you are still safe and in good spirits.

These next two weeks in my opinion will be the trying times for productivity and I'm up for the challenge.  I also think as a nation these will be the times where the under the surface tension will boil over.  I am focused on doing good through code and not let that hinder good will.

I'm still working on products to ship before the end of the month.  This 'lockdown' is really an opportunity to focus on things I 'didn't have enough time to complete' and I appreciate that despite all the chaos.  I definitely plan to finish 

I will finish cloud training this week....and begin more separate cloud training on Thursday.  If you are not skill building during this time start now.

Have a great Monday
