Funky weather means a funky song for coding....

### Song: Funkdafied

### Artist: Da Brat

### Album: Funkdafied

### Release Year: 1994

Heavy rain does not motivate me at all. It's supposed to rain hard all day in Atlanta and I have a busy schedule for a Thursday. Funkdafied weather means I have to be more intentional in getting things done especially when I have errands on top of coding tasks. Still another day to live means another day to grind so I won't let the rain stop me.
