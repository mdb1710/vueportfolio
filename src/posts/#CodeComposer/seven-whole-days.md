I (still) have cabin fever

I have lost time working on my personal projects because I have been deep into a freelance project but more time will be available next week.

I still have online interviews this week so I'm still trying to get work despite the uncertainty of this economy. April and May look to be tough months for our country so I'm glad I've gotten ahead of this

Also I apologize for the mini break I took from blogging but I needed the headspace. I will try my best to keep up the post from now on. Be safe and have a great week

### What I'm Working On

- More Freelance work
- Funding The Future Hackathon
- Studying for Google Interview

### What I Learning Right Now

- Etherium Development
- Tips for Typescript
