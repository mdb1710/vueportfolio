Happy (day after) Easter!

Because of COVID-19 you almost lose all sense of time when you're sheltering in place.  I've even had to rearrange my work hours so I don't experience a mini-burnout

I am working on a few new products which is why I have been to busy to blog.  Also I have been taking advantage of the training discounts happening right now.

I will try my best to keep up the post from now on. Be safe and have a great week

### What I'm Working On
