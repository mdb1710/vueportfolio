The sun finally came out on Friday and I was able to visit the Google Atlanta headquarters for the first time. It was an awesome all day experience learning about NgRx and seeing a glimpse of how the big G works. I get now why people would want to work at a big tech company.

I got to go to the NgRx workshop for free and it was a lot of information but I was so inspired about Angular and NgRx after I was done. The only negative was that it was an all day workshop so I didn't do much else for the day. It was worth it.
