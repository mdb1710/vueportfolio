Two days until my birthday....but it's still a Monday

Birthweek starts today!

Although my actual birthday is Wednesday I actually celebrated for two weeks minimum. Sometimes I start as early as the 18th (after my brother's birthday) and sometimes I start closer to the actual day. Birthweek is a way to intentionally enjoy life and remember its true value. I already got a early birthday present...

First was the free NgRx workshop I attended on Friday. The second I received via email later in the weekend. I got a free ticket to go to React Loop 2020. It's in Chicago in June and I've never been there.

I'll be working hard every day this week and celebrating life at the same time. For #mondaymotivation I hope you do the same.
