Happy (Almost) Leap Day!

Since my birthday is near the end of February I probably pay more attention to Leap Years than most people. I still need to look up who came with the algorithm for this. It means my birthday the following year will skip a day and so will NYE and Christmas Day.

I will be working hard this weekend because I have plenty of deadlines. But it's still Birthweek so I will be having some kind of fun in the sunshine. Have a great weekend!
