## February 11, 2020

Taking Up Time Tuesday as I like to call it.....

### Song: My Own Worst Enemy

### Artist: Lit

### Album: A Place In The Sun

### Release Year: 1999

I spent half of the day working on a coding challenge for a potential contract and as usual at first I overthough it and made it harder than it was supposed to be. In development I have to keep reminding myself to make to keep making the problem smaller and solving the pieces before solving the puzzle. I'm a big picture guy so I love looking at solutions that way but can easily get lost in it.

I also started the morning with a user research Zoom meeting about freelance developers. It was very insightful about where I want to take my career. I finished the day with freelance work which took up all of my time. Sorry for the late daily post lol.

### What I'm Working On

- Looking at two online hackathons
- Finishing the design for my Big Brother Canada quiz app
- Binge Watching Pluralsight course because of their Free Weekend promo
