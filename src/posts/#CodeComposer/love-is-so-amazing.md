Happy Single Awareness Day!

Work wise this was a long hard week. I got a lot done but I definitely wouldn't say this week was my Valentine. I still love composing things with code and even though I have been doing this for over a year there are so many opportunities.

Loving what you do is so amazing even if it isn't the only thing you do. I will be working a lot this three day weekend but I know it will be worth it. Have a safe weekend.
