# Why I Dove Into The Deep End of Tech Part Two

#### January 24, 2020

So what are my goals as a creative technologist?

I spent almost all of my after-bootcamp journey doing remote work both in marketing and in development. Although remote work was my initial goal I was discouraged intially from pursuing that exclusively as a new developer. That being said I'm kind of stubborn so here are my goals going forward in 2020.

Side Projects:

- MusicMoney -- Create an app to help independent artists track and plan out their revenue streams
- Big Brother Quizzes - Replicate the quiz apps I made last year for upcoming Big Brother seasons
- BirthChart -- Finish the app while shows the Billboard Top 100 charts that came out the week of your birthday and other milestones.
- Create a audio mastering app
- StudioFinder - create an app to help you find the closest recording studios in your city.

Career Goals:

- Continue to pursue short term gigs like Dananza
- Do development work for a music tech company either as an employee or contractor
- Continue to pursue the digital nomad lifestyle.

I'll be adding to the list so I will be referring to this post a lot for the next three months. Being a creative technologist is more than just a guy who codes but I am up to the challenge.
