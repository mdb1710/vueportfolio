# Why I Dove Into The Deep End of Tech Part One

#### January 13, 2020

So 2019 was a big year for me career-wise. I had a comforable job as a digital marketer since 2014 and I was finally able to start to balance that with my true passion: music. I also had a love for all things digital so I loved to learn more about social media tech and marketing automation. However in 2018 I became the one thing I always fear would do me in when it came to my career: restless.

So I made the decision in 2018 to resign from my job but I didn't do it lightly. I set up my own music LLC in the beginning of the year and set up a plan to leave cleanly. I finally pulled the plug with a nice intent to leave in Sept 2018...with a two month notice. Yes you read that right I intended to leave at the November which I did but I tried my best to make the transition as painless as possible. The only thing left was a backup plan when I finally exited.

So that's what I did in November by deciding to really commit to learning development. I applied for the Thinkful bootcamp and got accepted to join the January 2019 cohort. With the living stipend I would receive it would allow me to 'learn and earn' for the first six months of the year. I would also be combining my love for music and technology. Music tech and music apps are growing industries and it would be the best of both worlds for me.

Music software and digital audio workstations (DAWs) have been around forever but with the rise of IoT and the DIY movement when it comes to indie artists. I learned so much during the almost six months at Thinkful but I had to decide at the end of it if it would be another 'side thing' or would I really try to do both music and tech. The after bootcamp journey is a whole other subject that I will discuss in part two of this post.

Part two is coming soon:

- My 2020 goals as a developer & 'creative technologist'
- My direction on web developer vs. software development
